# Introduction

BuyWithCrypto is the first service offering to bridge the gap between cryptocurrencies and fiat currency. Founded by young teenagers, this service fills a real need in the current market.

## What is BuyWithCrypto?

BuyWithCrypto is a platform, which allows its users, to order a product on major marketplaces, directly in cryptocurrencies. It has a [DApp](https://app.buywithcrypto.fr/), allowing consumers to connect to their centralized or decentralized wallet and then pay with it.

## What is a DApp?

A DApp is a product which is hosted on a blockchain, the main benefit of which is that it has the full trust of its users. The user is fully aware of the use of the product he is using and all the processes that occur after he gives money. The DApp is a decentralized application; in the blockchain there are decentralized applications or DApps.

## What does BuyWithCrypto do?

The founders of BuyWithCrypto have created a solution for users who want to buy something on a third party marketplace, but without waiting for a payout. This solution allows the user to add the wallet from a service of the userâ€™s choice and pay for the product.

The advantage for the user is that he doesn't have to wait for the money to arrive in the wallet. The disadvantage is that the price is not always the lowest.

The BuyWithCrypto service has been on the market since 2021 and operates in two ways:

- as a centralized service where a user is connected to a cryptobank
- as a decentralized service, in which a user connects to the DApp of the company's choice

The company has decided to implement the decentralized service. A user buys on marketplaces, and connects to the service in order to get the product. The buyer gives the product's code to the decentralized service, and receives a confirmation. This confirmation has a number of actions that it can perform.

The most important use of this confirmation is that a user gets the wallet code to enter into the confirmation. Using this wallet code, a user can connect his wallet and pay in cryptocurrency for the product chosen on their marketplace.

DApp - Example
For the example, we will use the BuyWithCrypto decentralized service.

Let's say the user decided to order the product on Amazon.com, an American website. The user goes to [https://app.buywithcrypto.fr/](https://app.buywithcrypto.fr/) and connects to the decentralized service. He chooses BTC as the currency.

First, the user is asked to create a wallet or to log in. It is a safe place for him to receive payments. To do this, the user is asked to enter its identifying information and then click on the login button.

After that, the user's wallet appears on the screen.

Now that the user has a wallet, the username appears on the screen. This username is what we will use in the next step to receive the order confirmation and interact to a DApp.

You have a choice of wallet, the user is asked to go to the service that he wants to use. For this example, we will use the Metamask decentralized service. He inserts the wallet code in order to use the service. After doing this, a confirmation window appears. The user is is redirected to the platform dashboard. It looks like this.

There are two actions possible here.
The first action is to pay for the product using the product code. Let's look at the user who just bought an item on Amazon.com.

The second action is to wait for confirmation of the order. This might happen if the user has sent in the wrong amount, so they will have to top up the amount indicated.

The service in BuyWithCrypto allows the user to be notified when the product has arrived at home.

## BuyWithCrypto - Future

BuyWithCrypto is the first service to offer users with a cryptocurrency wallet to use in their local services. The company, however, will continue to expand its range of services.

BuyWithCrypto is looking to develop a service that allows users to buy and sell their products through DApps. We will tell you more about this soon.

The buying process is simple. A user has to choose a product from the marketplaces, enter the product reference, and confirm the payment.
